# Project-Task-Tracker
The Task Tracker is a handy tool that aids in the effective management of daily tasks with the ability to display, create, edit, and delete tasks. It ensures that no tasks slip through the gaps.

This project repository includes the following files:

index.html: This file defines the default webpage where the Task Tracker can be accessed.
main.css: In this file, we define the HTML page's style and formatting.
main.js: This is the JavaScript code for the functionality of the Task Tracker tool.

To run this code, download all the files listed above in a single folder and open them using Visual Studio Code to customise them as per your requirements.

Click on index.html to run the Task Tracker in your browser.
